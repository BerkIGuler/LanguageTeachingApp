# EEE102-OV7670
Digital Design Course Project

The objective of this project is to design a logic circuit that can control a camera, can save data on the memory, and can transmit this to the outside world. Following the transmission of the image data, OCR and TTS are performed on the image.

Peripherals:
* OV-7670 Image Sensor
* Xilinx Basys3 FPGA Board
